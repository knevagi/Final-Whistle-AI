                Analyze the following match data and extract the FINAL SCORE for the match between {home_team} and {away_team}.
                
                MATCH DATA TO ANALYZE:
                {match_data}
                
                CURRENT DATABASE SCORE: {current_home_score}-{current_away_score} {"(NO SCORE IN DATABASE)" if current_home_score is None or current_away_score is None else ""}
                
                Your task is to:
                1. Carefully read through all the match data provided
                2. Identify the definitive final score of the match
                3. Look for phrases like "final score", "result", "ended", "finished", "victory", "defeat"
                4. Extract the score in the format "home_score-away_score" (e.g., "2-1", "0-0", "3-2")
                5. If you find multiple score mentions, prioritize the final/definitive score
                6. If no clear final score is found, respond with "NO_SCORE_FOUND"
                
                IMPORTANT RULES:
                - Only extract the FINAL score, not half-time or provisional scores
                - The score should be in format "home_score-away_score" where home_score is {home_team}'s goals and away_score is {away_team}'s goals
                - If the current database score is None-None (no score in database) and you find a score, return the found score
                - If the score matches the current database score ({current_home_score}-{current_away_score}), respond with "SCORE_CONFIRMED"
                - If you find a different score than what's in the database, respond with just the score (e.g., "2-1")
                - If you cannot determine the final score with confidence, respond with "NO_SCORE_FOUND"
                
                CRITICAL: If the database has no score (None-None) and you find a score in the match data, you MUST return the found score, NOT "SCORE_CONFIRMED".
                
                EXAMPLES:
                - If database shows "None-None" and you find "0-3", return "0-3"
                - If database shows "0-0" and you find "0-3", return "0-3" 
                - If database shows "0-3" and you find "0-3", return "SCORE_CONFIRMED"
                - If database shows "0-3" and you find "1-2", return "1-2"
                - If no clear score found, return "NO_SCORE_FOUND"
                
                Respond with ONLY one of these options:
                
                Respond with ONLY one of these options:
                - "SCORE_CONFIRMED" (if score matches database)
                - "NO_SCORE_FOUND" (if no clear final score found)
